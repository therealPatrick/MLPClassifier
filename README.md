# MLPClassifier
Building an MLP Classifier from Scratch in Python. Tested on the MNIST Dataset.

Usage instructions:

1. Enter the number of layers (including the input and output layers). eg 5
2. Enter the number of neurons per layer (including the input and output layers). For the MNIST dataset, the input layer must contain 28*28 neurons and the output layer must contain 10 neurons. eg 785 256 128 64 10
3. Enter the activation function to be used for the classifier (Linear/ReLU/Sigmoid/tanh). eg ReLU
4. Enter the learning rate to be used by the classifier. eg 0.1

Default number of iterations: 15
Default batch size: 200

Output:

Prints the plot of the errors against iterations and the training and testing errors.
